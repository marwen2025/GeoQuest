Introduction
GeoQuest is a unique AR game that encourages players to explore their surroundings while engaging in educational challenges. Players interact with virtual questioners, answer questions on various topics, and participate in challenges to earn experience points (XP) and level up.

Gameplay Features
Initial Setup
Sign-Up/Log-In: Players begin by signing up or logging into the game, setting up their profiles, creating a unique username, and customizing their avatars.
Exploring the Real World
Map View: Using the Mapbox SDK, players view a map of their current location, with markers indicating questioners and challenges.
Moving Around: As players move in the real world, their in-game avatar moves accordingly, updating their location in real-time.
AR Question Scene
Finding Questioners: Players locate questioner markers on the map, representing virtual NPCs.
Interacting with a Questioner: Upon reaching a questioner marker, players tap on it to enter an AR scene, where they see the questioner in their real-world environment.
Answering Questions: Players answer questions from categories like science, history, geography, or sports, selecting the correct answer from multiple choices.
Gaining XP: Correct answers reward players with XP, helping them level up.
